          <h3>Welcome to the Open Astrophysics Bookshelf</h3>

	  <p>This is a collection of open-licensed, freely available
	    texts on various topics in astrophysics.  You are free to
	    use them as-is, make mash-ups of different texts, or
	    contribute back to their development.</p>

	  <p>Texts are written in LaTeX and managed as a github repositiory
	    under the Open-Astrophysics-Bookshelf github organization.
	    Each text has a lead author who manages the contributions.  Anyone
	    else can contribute by forking a text's project repo, making
	    modifications, and then issuing a pull-request through the
	    github website.</p>

	  <p>Any type of contribution is welcomed&mdash;typos,
	    clarifications, new chapters, etc.  All contributors will
	    be acknowledged in the text, for instance, by having a
	    hierarchical author list giving the lead author(s), major
	    contributing authors, and then authors who make minor
	    corrections/clarifications. (And of course the git history
	    will list all contributions.)</p>

	  <p>All the books in the Open Astrophysics Bookshelf are
	    living&mdash; they continually evolve.  But since it is
	    all managed by git, the entire history of the text is
	    freely available to anyone.  A git hash can be used to
	    reference a particular instance of the text.</p>
	    

	  <h3>Current Texts</h3>

	  <h4>Computational Hydrodynamics for Astrophysics</h4>

	  <p>An introduction to the grid-based methods commonly used
	    for astrophysical simulation, starting with linear
	    advection and developing the methods for the compressible
	    Euler equations, multigrid, diffusion, multiphysics
	    problems, incompressible flow, and low Mach number flows.</p>
	  
	  <p>Links to simple python scripts implementing the basic ideas
	    are embedded in the text, and all the methods described here
	    are implemented in two-dimensional in the companion
	    <a href="https://github.com/zingale/pyro2">pyro</a> code.</p>


	  <p>Get the text's source:
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/Open-Astrophysics-Bookshelf/numerical_exercises.git</code></pre>


	  <h3>Become an Author!</h3>

	  <p>If you'd like your book hosted on this project page,
	    create
	    a <a href="https://github.com/Open-Astrophysics-Bookshelf/Open-Astrophysics-Bookshelf.github.io/issues">github
	    issue for this website</a> giving the text's title,
	    summary, and (proposed) table on contents.  We'll create a
	    new project repo for your text in the Open Astrophysics
	    Bookshelf organization, with you as the owner.</p>
